        Please consider the following suggestions: <br>

        1. Manure – adding manure is one of the simplest ways to amend your soil with nitrogen. Be careful as there are
        various
        types of manures with varying degrees of nitrogen. <br>
        2. Coffee grinds – Coffee grinds are considered a green compost material which is rich in nitrogen. Once the
        grounds
        break down, your soil will be fed with delicious nitrogen. It also provides increased drainage to your soil.
        <br>
        3. Plant nitrogen fixing plants – planting vegetables that are in Fabaceae family like peas, beans and soybeans
        have the
        ability to increase nitrogen in your soil. <br>
        4. Plant ‘green manure’ crops like cabbage, corn and brocolli. <br>
        5. Use mulch (wet grass) while growing crops - Mulch can also include sawdust and scrap soft woods. <br>

        {% elif nkey == "Nlow" %}
        <h4><b>The N value of your soil is low. </b></h4>

        Please consider the following suggestions: <br>

        1. Water – soaking your soil with water will help leach the nitrogen deeper into your soil, effectively leaving
        less for
        your plants to use. <br>
        2. Add composted manure to the soil. <br>
        3. Plant Nitrogen fixing plants like peas or beans. <br>
        4. Use NPK fertilizers with high N value. <br>
        5. Do nothing – It may seem counter-intuitive, but if you already have plants that are producing lots of
        foliage, it may
        be best to let them continue to absorb all the nitrogen to amend the soil for your next crops. <br>
        {% else %}
        <h4><b>The N value of your soil is within the optimal range.</b></h4>

        {% if pkey == "PHigh" %}
        <br><h4><b>
                The P value of your soil is high. </b></h4>

        Please consider the following suggestions: <br>

        1. Avoid adding manure – manure contains many key nutrients for your soil but typically including high levels of
        phosphorous. <br>
        2. Use only phosphorus-free fertilizer – if you can limit the amount of phosphorous added to your soil, you can
        let
        the
        plants use the existing phosphorus while still providing other key nutrients such as Nitrogen and Potassium.
        Find a
        fertilizer with numbers such as 10-0-10, where the zero represents no phosphorous. <br>
        3. Water your soil – soaking your soil liberally will aid in driving phosphorous out of the soil. This is
        recommended as
        a last ditch effor <br>
        4. Plant nitrogen fixing vegetables to increase nitrogen without increasing phosphorous (like beans and peas).
        <br>
        5. Use crop rotations to decrease high phosphorous levels. <br>

        {% elif pkey == "Plow" %}<br><h4><b>
                The P value of your soil is low. </b></h4>

        Please consider the following suggestions: <br>

        1. Bone meal – a fast acting source that is made from ground animal bones which is rich in phosphorous. <br>
        2. Rock phosphate – a slower acting source where the soil needs to convert the rock phosphate into phosphorous
        that
        the
        plants can use. <br>
        3. Phosphorus Fertilizers – applying a fertilizer with a high phosphorous content in the NPK ratio (example:
        10-20-10,
        20 being phosphorous percentage). <br>
        4. Organic compost – adding quality organic compost to your soil will help increase phosphorous content. <br>
        5. Manure – as with compost, manure can be an excellent source of phosphorous for your plants. <br>

        {% if kkey == "KHigh" %}
        <br><h4><b>
                The K value of your soil is high. </b></h4>

        Please consider the following suggestions: <br>

        1. Loosen the soil- deeply with a shovel, and water thoroughly to dissolve water-soluble potassium. Allow the
        soil
        to
        fully dry, and repeat digging and watering the soil two or three more times. <br>
        2. Sift through the soil, and remove as many rocks as possible, using a soil sifter. Minerals occurring in rocks
        such as
        mica and feldspar slowly release potassium into the soil slowly through weathering. <br>
        3. Mix crushed eggshells, crushed seashells, wood ash or soft rock phosphate to the soil to add calcium. Mix in
        up
        to 10
        percent of organic compost to help amend and balance the soil. <br>
        4. Use NPK fertilizers with low K levels and organic fertilizers since they have low NPK values. <br>
        5. Grow a cover crop of legumes that will fix nitrogen in the soil. This practice will meet the soil’s needs for
        nitrogen without increasing phosphorus or potassium. <br>
        {% elif kkey == "Klow" %}
        <br><h4><b>The K value of your soil is low. </b></h4>

        Please consider the following suggestions: <br>

        1. Mix in muricate of potash or sulphate of potash <br>
        2. Try kelp meal or seaweed <br>
        3. Try Sul-Po-Mag <br>
        4. Bury banana peels an inch below the soils surface <br>
        5. Use Potash fertilizers since they contain high values potassium <br>

        {% if phkey == "phHigh" %}
        <br><h4><b>
                The pH value of your soil is high. </b></h4>

        Please consider the following suggestions: <br>

        1. Aluminium Sulphate : Aluminum sulfate will change the soil pH instantly because the aluminum produces the
        acidity
        as soon as it dissolves in the soil. <br>
        2. Sulfur : Sulfur requires some time for the conversion to sulfuric acid with the aid of soil bacteria. The
        conversion rate of the sulfur is dependent on the fineness of the sulfur, the amount of soil moisture, soil
        temperature and the presence of the bacteria. <br>
        3. Addition of appreciable amount of organic matter will help acidify the soil. <br>
        {% elif phkey == "phLow" %}
        <br><h4><b>
                The pH value of your soil is low. </b></h4>

        Please consider the following suggestions: <br>

        1. Selecting a Liming Material: Hydrated lime should be used with caution since it has a greater ability to
        neutralize soil acidity than regular limestone. <br>
        2. Wood Ashes: Wood ashes can be used to raise the soil pH. They contain fairly high amounts of potassium &
        calcium,
        and small amounts of phosphate, boron and other elements. They are not as effective as limestone but with
        repeated
        use, they can drastically raise the pH value of a soil, especially if the soil is sandy in texture. <br>
        3. Add lime or potassium carbonate to the soil as fertilizers. Pure calcium carbonate is very effective in
        increasing the pH value of the soil. <br>
